# Teal's Daily Fact Challenge

A classroom-first multiplication fact fluency game built around one short shared competition, a private adaptive learning routine, and a just-for-fun weekly curiosity reward.

## The daily student routine

Every signed-in student follows the same learning path:

**Daily 10 → Fix Your Misses → Your Focus Practice → ⭐ Day Complete → 🕵️ Weekly Mystery**

### 1. Daily 10

- Every class gets the **same balanced 10 facts in the same order** each day.
- The core is **2s-10s**. Selected days include one 11/12 extension fact; never more than one.
- Fact 1 counts for accuracy but is untimed. Submitting Fact 1 starts the timed sprint for Facts 2-10.
- The timer runs **quietly in the background**. Students do not watch a ticking stopwatch.
- Accuracy ranks first; time breaks ties.
- No right/wrong feedback is shown until the Daily 10 is complete.
- Students see only their own class **Top 10**. Lower exact ranks stay private.

### 2. Fix Your Misses

Every missed Daily fact is immediately taught with the correct equation, a multiplication array, repeated-addition meaning, a derived-fact strategy, and a required correct retry before moving on.

A correction retry is teaching—not a new mastery observation—so it does not artificially raise the student's profile.

### 3. Your Focus Practice

Each student receives **8 personalized retrievals** chosen from the mastery profile attached to that student account.

The app intentionally has **no placement test**. A new student begins with 45 core facts marked as `Learning`, with zero invented evidence. The profile gradually develops from normal Daily Challenge retrievals and first-try answers in assigned Focus Practice.

Focus Practice mixes facts currently needing support, facts still building, a small amount of new evidence gathering, stronger maintenance facts, and spaced repeats of priority facts rather than immediate drilling.

For new/mostly-unknown profiles, exploration is **relationship-aware**: 2s, 5s, and 10s are used as early anchor relationships, then derived facts move forward as their supporting anchors become Building/Fluent. There is still no placement test or giant opening assessment.

If a Focus answer is missed, the student sees visual/strategy teaching and must retry correctly. The retry teaches the fact but does not count as independent retrieval evidence.

### 4. ⭐ Day Complete

Completing the full learning routine earns one **Daily Star**, progress toward a private **Learning Streak**, and milestone celebrations at 3, 5, 10, 20, 30, 50 days and later 50-day milestones.

The reward is for **finishing the learning routine**, not for being fast or being on the leaderboard.

### 5. 🕵️ Weekly Mystery

The Weekly Mystery is a curiosity reward that appears only after the full learning routine is complete.

- One shared mystery is used across every class for the school week.
- Monday-Thursday: each completed routine earns the **next clue in order**.
- Students have **one guess for the entire week**. They can use it early or save it.
- A missed school day simply means the student has fewer early clues; clue numbering never has holes.
- Friday: completing the routine shows the full four-clue set, gives an unused guess one final chance, and then reveals the answer.
- Correct early guesses earn a private solve title such as **One-Clue Wonder** or **Sharp Detective**.
- Mystery solves are private and never affect Daily rank, mastery, Stars, or streaks.

The built-in bank contains **80 curated mysteries** across Places, Animals, Foods, Sports, Science & Nature, History & People, Music & Entertainment, and Games/Toys/Objects. It is local to the app, so clue delivery never relies on a live web search.

## Persistent mastery

The core mastery map contains the 45 commutative facts from 2×2 through 10×10. `6×7` and `7×6` are one underlying fact.

Student-facing statuses are intentionally simple:

- 🟢 **Fluent**
- 🟡 **Building**
- 🔴 **Focus**
- ⚪ **Learning**

Accuracy is primary. Response time is used only after accurate retrieval has been established; speed never rescues weak accuracy.

The map is stored in Supabase and follows the student's nickname/PIN account across devices and future logins.

## Extra Practice

Practice remains unlimited and lets students choose **My Focus Facts**, Mixed Facts, or 2s through 12s.

Every Practice miss uses **teach → retry correctly → next**, with an array and derived-fact strategy. Extra/manual Practice is saved for history but does not currently change the formal mastery map; the formal profile is deliberately based on the common Daily Challenge and assigned Focus Practice.

## Teacher Dashboard

The private Teacher Dashboard supports roughly 90 students across multiple classes.

### Today

Teachers can see Daily completion, full learning-routine completion, accuracy/time, private streak and star information, each student's current routine step, visible classroom PINs, and the student-visible class Top 10.

### Mastery & Focus

Teachers can see a full 45-fact class heatmap, facts showing the greatest observed need, an individual student's mastery map, and optional Focus overrides.

Override priority is:

**Student override → Class override → All-student override → Automatic personalization**

### Weekly Mystery

Teachers can preview the week's answer and all four clues, see unlock/guess/solve counts, and press **Pick Another Mystery** before any student earns a clue. Once the first clue is earned, the mystery locks for the week so students cannot receive a changed answer midstream.

### Student Tools

Teachers can see each student's classroom PIN beside the nickname, rename nicknames, move one or many students between classes, permanently delete accidental/duplicate accounts with confirmation, reset/change PINs, deactivate/reactivate accounts, reset today's Daily after a legitimate technology problem, and temporarily override one student's Focus family.

## Daily fact generator

The shared Daily generator remains versioned as `TDFC-DAILY-v1`, so the previously audited Daily sequence does not change in v2.2.2.

Each Daily contains 10 unique underlying multiplication facts. Commutative mirrors cannot both appear. Normal core days contain 3 easier, 4 medium, and 3 harder facts. On selected extension days, one harder slot becomes one 11/12 fact.

## Data and privacy

- Student accounts use teacher-assigned nicknames and 4-digit classroom PINs.
- Teacher-only views retain a readable copy of classroom PINs while authentication still verifies the salted scrypt hash.
- Student-facing pages never show classmates' PINs.
- No student email, school ID, or legal name is required.
- Supabase Row Level Security is enabled on all app tables with no public browser policies.
- The Streamlit server uses the private `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY`; students never receive database credentials.
- Weekly guesses are private to the student and teacher data layer; there is no class guessing leaderboard.
- There is intentionally **no social sharing feature**.

## Streamlit Secrets

```toml
SUPABASE_URL = "https://YOUR-PROJECT.supabase.co"
SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY = "YOUR-SERVER-SECRET-KEY"
TEACHER_PASSWORD = "CHOOSE-A-PRIVATE-TEACHER-PASSWORD"
```

## Updating an existing installation

**Current live v2.2 installation:** v2.2.3 is a code-only fast roster-delete hotfix. **No Supabase SQL is required.** Upload every file/folder in `UPLOAD_TO_GITHUB` to the existing GitHub repo and let Streamlit redeploy.

**If coming from v2.1:** run `RUN_THIS_ONCE_IN_SUPABASE_v2_2.sql` first, then upload the v2.2.3 app files.

**If already on v2.0 but not v2.1:** run `RUN_THIS_ONCE_IN_SUPABASE_v2_1.sql`, then `RUN_THIS_ONCE_IN_SUPABASE_v2_2.sql`.

**If still on v1:** the packaged `RUN_THIS_ONCE_IN_SUPABASE_v2.sql` is the combined migration and includes adaptive learning, teacher-visible PINs, and Weekly Mystery.

Do not rerun `SUPABASE_SCHEMA.sql` on an existing project. It is the full schema for a brand-new installation.

Make sure `daily_sprint_component/index.html` remains present in GitHub.

## Version notes

### v2.2.3 — Fast Roster Delete Hotfix

- **Delete selected student(s)** now sends one true bulk database delete instead of deleting each selected student one at a time.
- Adds **Clear this entire roster** under each class for fast cleanup when a whole roster was entered by mistake.
- Whole-roster clear keeps the class itself but permanently removes every student in it and their linked history.
- Whole-roster clear requires typing `DELETE <class name>` before the button enables.
- Single-student permanent delete was also reduced to one database request.
- Code-only update: no database migration or new Streamlit secret.

### v2.2.2 — Visible Roster Management Hotfix

- Adds an obvious **Roster Management** section directly under each class roster in **Classes & Students**.
- Select one or many students at once.
- **Move selected student(s)** preserves PIN, mastery, Stars, streak, Daily history, Focus work, and Mystery history.
- **Delete selected student(s)** supports permanent bulk cleanup with an explicit confirmation checkbox.
- Existing individual Student Tools remain available.
- Code-only update: no database migration or new Streamlit secret.

### v2.2.0 — Weekly Mystery

Adds the post-routine **Weekly Mystery** motivation loop. Monday-Thursday full completion unlocks clues, each student has one guess for the entire week, and Friday provides the final guess/reveal. Includes an 80-mystery local bank, private solve stats, and a Teacher Dashboard preview/replacement control that locks after the first clue is earned.

The multiplication learning model, Daily generator, accuracy-first Top 10, Focus personalization, mastery evidence, Stars, streaks, and visible teacher PIN system are unchanged.

### v2.1.0 — Research Alignment + Teacher PIN Visibility

Tightened early adaptive exploration around 2s/5s/10s anchor relationships and retained teacher-readable classroom PINs in teacher-only views.
