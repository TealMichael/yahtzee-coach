# Teal's Daily Fact Challenge

A classroom-first multiplication fact fluency game built around one short shared competition, a private adaptive learning routine, and a just-for-fun weekly curiosity reward.

## The daily student routine

Every signed-in student follows the same learning path:

**Daily 10 → Fix Your Misses → Your Focus Practice → ⭐ Day Complete → 🕵️ Weekly Mystery**

### 1. Daily 10

- Every class gets the **same balanced 10 facts in the same order** each day.
- The core is **2s-10s**. Selected days include one 11/12 extension fact; never more than one.
- Fact 1 counts for accuracy but is untimed. Submitting Fact 1 starts the timed sprint for Facts 2-10.
- The timer runs **quietly in the background**. Students do not watch a ticking stopwatch.
- Accuracy ranks first; time breaks ties.
- No right/wrong feedback is shown until the Daily 10 is complete.
- Students answer with a large **phone-style touch number pad**. Digit taps stay entirely in the browser; the physical keyboard remains an optional fallback.
- The class **Top 10 appears immediately after the Daily 10** using the already-cached standings, then gets out of the way during Fix/Focus. It shows **rank + nickname only**. Classmates' accuracy and times stay teacher-only, and lower exact ranks stay private.

### 2. Fix Your Misses

Every missed Daily fact is immediately taught with the correct equation, a multiplication array, repeated-addition meaning, a derived-fact strategy, and a required correct retry before moving on.

Fix Your Misses uses the same large touch number pad, so students do not need to open a software keyboard.

A correction retry is teaching—not a new mastery observation—so it does not artificially raise the student's profile.

### 3. Your Focus Practice

Each student receives **8 personalized retrievals** chosen from the mastery profile attached to that student account.

The app intentionally has **no placement test**. A new student begins with 45 core facts marked as `Learning`, with zero invented evidence. The profile gradually develops from normal Daily Challenge retrievals and first-try answers in assigned Focus Practice.

Focus Practice mixes facts currently needing support, facts still building, a small amount of new evidence gathering, stronger maintenance facts, and spaced repeats of priority facts rather than immediate drilling.

For new/mostly-unknown profiles, exploration is **relationship-aware**: 2s, 5s, and 10s are used as early anchor relationships, then derived facts move forward as their supporting anchors become Building/Fluent. There is still no placement test or giant opening assessment.

If a Focus answer is missed, the student sees visual/strategy teaching and must retry correctly. The retry teaches the fact but does not count as independent retrieval evidence.

Focus Practice also uses the browser-local touch number pad. Number taps do not rerun Streamlit or touch Supabase; only pressing ✓ submits the answer.

### 4. ⭐ Day Complete

The finish screen is intentionally short: **YOU'RE DONE FOR TODAY!**, the three learning steps checked off, the student's Star/streak, and then the earned Weekly Mystery. Growth and Daily review remain available in collapsed optional sections instead of crowding the finish.

Completing the full learning routine earns one **Daily Star**, progress toward a private **Learning Streak**, and milestone celebrations at 3, 5, 10, 20, 30, 50 days and later 50-day milestones. The reward is for **finishing the learning routine**, not for being fast or being on the leaderboard.

### 5. 🕵️ Weekly Mystery

The Weekly Mystery is a curiosity reward that appears only after the full learning routine is complete.

- One shared mystery is used across every class for the school week.
- **Monday-Thursday:** each completed routine earns the next clue in order.
- Students **cannot guess Monday-Wednesday**.
- **Thursday:** a completed routine unlocks **Guess #1 of 2**.
- **Friday:** a completed routine unlocks **Guess #2 of 2**, then the answer is revealed.
- Missed clue days are **never backfilled**. A student who completes only Monday and Thursday has only two clues on Thursday and still only those two clues for the Friday final guess.
- Thursday and Friday guesses are separate; an unused Thursday guess does not roll into Friday.
- Mystery solves are private and never affect Daily rank, mastery, Stars, or streaks.

The built-in bank contains **80 curated mysteries** across Places, Animals, Foods, Sports, Science & Nature, History & People, Music & Entertainment, and Games/Toys/Objects. It is local to the app, so clue delivery never relies on a live web search.

## Persistent mastery

The core mastery map contains the 45 commutative facts from 2×2 through 10×10. `6×7` and `7×6` are one underlying fact.

Student-facing statuses are intentionally simple:

- 🟢 **Fluent**
- 🟡 **Building**
- 🔴 **Focus**
- ⚪ **Learning**

Accuracy is primary. Response time is used only after accurate retrieval has been established; speed never rescues weak accuracy.

The map is stored in Supabase and follows the student's nickname/PIN account across devices and future logins.

## Optional 30-day remembered sign-in

On an assigned Chromebook or iPad, a student can check **Keep me signed in on this device for 30 days** when entering the nickname + PIN. The browser stores a signed login token, **not the student's PIN**, and the app re-checks the current student record before restoring the account.

- Remembered login expires after 30 days.
- **Sign out** clears it immediately.
- Resetting the student's PIN invalidates the older remembered login.
- Deactivating or deleting the student also prevents restoration.
- Students should leave the box unchecked on a shared device.

## Extra Practice

Practice remains unlimited and lets students choose **My Focus Facts**, Mixed Facts, or 2s through 12s.

Every Practice miss uses **teach → retry correctly → next**, with an array and derived-fact strategy. Extra/manual Practice is saved for history but does not currently change the formal mastery map; the formal profile is deliberately based on the common Daily Challenge and assigned Focus Practice.

## Teacher Dashboard

The private Teacher Dashboard supports roughly 90 students across multiple classes.

### Today

The teacher home view is organized around **🟢 Done / 🟡 Working / ⚪ Not started**. PINs and routine status stay visible in the main table; accuracy and timing are tucked into a teacher-only detail section. **Done** means Daily 10 + Fix Your Misses + Focus Practice are complete; using the Mystery guess is optional.

### Mastery & Focus

Teachers can see a full 45-fact class heatmap, facts showing the greatest observed need, an individual student's mastery map, and optional Focus overrides.

Override priority is:

**Student override → Class override → All-student override → Automatic personalization**

### Weekly Mystery

Teachers can preview the week's answer and all four clues, see unlock/guess/solve counts, and press **Pick Another Mystery** before any student earns a clue. Once the first clue is earned, the mystery locks for the week so students cannot receive a changed answer midstream.

### Classes & Rosters / Student Support

Every existing teacher function remains available, but the dashboard is reorganized into **Today → Classes & Rosters → Mastery & Focus → Weekly Mystery → Student Support**. Whole-class setup and roster management live together; one-student troubleshooting groups nickname/PIN, Daily reset, Focus override, move/status, and permanent-delete tools into clearly labeled sections.

## Daily fact generator

The shared Daily generator remains versioned as `TDFC-DAILY-v1`, so the previously audited Daily sequence does not change in v2.5.0.

Each Daily contains 10 unique underlying multiplication facts. Commutative mirrors cannot both appear. Normal core days contain 3 easier, 4 medium, and 3 harder facts. On selected extension days, one harder slot becomes one 11/12 fact.

## Data and privacy

- Student accounts use teacher-assigned nicknames and 4-digit classroom PINs.
- Optional 30-day remembered sign-in stores only a server-signed browser token; the PIN itself is not stored in browser local storage.
- Teacher-only views retain a readable copy of classroom PINs while authentication still verifies the salted scrypt hash.
- Student-facing pages never show classmates' PINs.
- No student email, school ID, or legal name is required.
- Supabase Row Level Security is enabled on all app tables with no public browser policies.
- The Streamlit server uses the private `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY`; students never receive database credentials.
- Weekly guesses are private to the student and teacher data layer; there is no class guessing leaderboard.
- There is intentionally **no social sharing feature**.

## Streamlit Secrets

```toml
SUPABASE_URL = "https://YOUR-PROJECT.supabase.co"
SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY = "YOUR-SERVER-SECRET-KEY"
TEACHER_PASSWORD = "CHOOSE-A-PRIVATE-TEACHER-PASSWORD"
```

## Updating an existing installation

**Current live v2.4 installation:** run `RUN_THIS_ONCE_IN_SUPABASE_v2_5.sql` once in a **new Supabase SQL Editor query**, then upload every file/folder in `UPLOAD_TO_GITHUB` to the existing GitHub repo and let Streamlit redeploy.

No new Streamlit Secret is required. Do **not** rerun v2, v2.1, v2.2, or `SUPABASE_SCHEMA.sql`.

Make sure all three browser-component folders are present in GitHub:

- `daily_sprint_component/index.html`
- `answer_pad_component/index.html`
- `persistent_login_component/index.html`

`SUPABASE_SCHEMA.sql` represents the current full schema for a brand-new installation.

## Version notes

### v2.5.0 — Student Experience Pass

- Replaces multiplication answer typing with a large phone-style touch number pad in Daily 10, Fix Your Misses, assigned Focus Practice, and optional Practice.
- Number-pad digit taps are browser-local; they do not rerun Streamlit or call Supabase. Only ✓ submits an answer. Physical keyboard entry remains supported as a fallback.
- Restores the class Top 10 immediately after the Daily 10 using the cached leaderboard snapshot; it appears once and does not reload during every Fix/Focus rerun.
- Keeps student Top 10 privacy at **rank + nickname only**; scores/times remain teacher-only.
- Simplifies Day Complete so the finish message + Mystery reward dominate, with Growth and Daily Review collapsed as optional detail.
- Changes Weekly Mystery to the classroom rule: earned clues Monday-Thursday, no guessing Monday-Wednesday, Guess #1 Thursday, Guess #2 Friday, then reveal.
- Skipped clue days are never backfilled on Thursday or Friday.
- Adds the one-time `RUN_THIS_ONCE_IN_SUPABASE_v2_5.sql` migration so Thursday and Friday guesses have separate persistent database slots.
- Preserves adaptive mastery, no-placement-test learning, classroom-load retries/batching, fast Focus Practice, teacher tools, 30-day login, Stars, and school-day streaks.

### v2.4.0 — 30-Day Remembered Student Login

- Adds an optional **Keep me signed in on this device for 30 days** checkbox to student login.
- Uses a signed browser token rather than storing the 4-digit PIN itself.
- Automatically restores the student's current nickname/class on the same device while the token is valid.
- **Sign out** clears the remembered login immediately.
- A teacher PIN reset invalidates the older remembered login; deleted/deactivated accounts also cannot restore.
- Intended for assigned student devices; the login screen explicitly says to leave the box unchecked on shared devices.
- Preserves v2.3 classroom clarity, v2.2.6 Focus speed improvements, and v2.2.5 classroom-load reliability work.
- Code-only update: no database migration and no new Streamlit secret.

### v2.3.0 — Classroom Clarity Pass

- Adds a persistent four-part student progress strip: **Daily 10 → Fix Misses → Focus → Mystery reward**.
- Replaces the subtle finish state with an unmistakable **YOU'RE DONE FOR TODAY!** screen and an explicit **All done. See you next Challenge day!** ending.
- Makes it clear that the Mystery clue is **earned after the learning work** and that using the one weekly guess is optional.
- Adds an explicit **I'm waiting for another clue · Done for today ✓** choice so students never wonder whether they have another required step.
- Hardens Top 10 privacy: after Supabase performs the private accuracy/time ranking, the student-side leaderboard context discards all score/time fields and keeps only **student ID + nickname + rank**.
- Reorganizes Teacher Mode into **Today, Classes & Rosters, Mastery & Focus, Weekly Mystery, Student Support** without removing any teacher function.
- Today now emphasizes **Done / Working / Not started**; teacher-only accuracy and timing are moved into a secondary detail section.
- Classes & Rosters groups class creation, student creation/PINs, roster exports, moves, bulk delete, and clear-roster tools.
- Student Support groups one-student nickname/PIN, Daily reset, Focus override, move/status, and permanent-delete tools.
- Preserves the v2.2.5 classroom-load retry/batching work and v2.2.6 Focus Practice performance improvements.
- Code-only update: no database migration or new Streamlit secret.

### v2.2.6 — Focus Practice Speed Hotfix

- Confirms the classroom slowdown was partly caused by the Top 10 being reloaded on every Streamlit rerun during Focus Practice. The leaderboard snapshot is now loaded once and reused until Day Complete.
- Focus Practice activity rows and teacher-focus settings are cached for the current student session instead of being re-read after every answer.
- Reuses the already-loaded learning-progress record when building the Focus plan.
- First-try Focus answers now save with one normal insert instead of a pre-read plus insert; duplicate submissions still fall back safely to the existing stored answer.
- Focus mastery evidence is accumulated from the eight stored first attempts and applied in one idempotent batch at the end of Focus Practice instead of two mastery requests after every answer.
- The learning model, 8-item Focus plan, correction behavior, Daily ranking, Weekly Mystery, and Teacher Tools are unchanged.
- Code-only update: no database migration or new Streamlit secret.

### v2.2.5 — Classroom Load Reliability Hotfix

- Adds automatic retry/backoff for transient Supabase/httpx read failures such as the classroom `httpx.ReadError` seen when many students finish together.
- Batches the 10 Daily mastery updates into roughly **2 database requests instead of about 20 per student** while preserving the same mastery math.
- Reuses one leaderboard snapshot on the completed-Daily screen instead of repeatedly loading the same class data in a single rerun.
- If the database is briefly busy after a completed Daily, students now see a friendly **Try again** message rather than a giant Streamlit traceback; completed Daily work does not need to be repeated.
- Keeps v2.2.4 student leaderboard privacy intact.
- Teacher Tools UI is intentionally untouched; its cleanup remains deferred until after classroom feedback.
- Code-only update: no database migration or new Streamlit secret.

### v2.2.4 — Student Leaderboard Privacy Hotfix

- Student Top 10 now shows **rank + nickname only**.
- Classmates' accuracy and timed-sprint values are no longer visible to students.
- Student result summary no longer displays the timed sprint or a numeric accuracy score; it keeps Top 10 status and the instructional **Facts to Fix** count.
- Accuracy and timing remain fully available in the Teacher Dashboard and still determine ranking privately: accuracy first, time as the tiebreaker.
- Teacher UI layout is intentionally unchanged in this hotfix; the planned Teacher Tools cleanup remains deferred until after classroom feedback.
- Code-only update: no database migration or new Streamlit secret.

### v2.2.3 — Fast Roster Delete Hotfix

- **Delete selected student(s)** now sends one true bulk database delete instead of deleting each selected student one at a time.
- Adds **Clear this entire roster** under each class for fast cleanup when a whole roster was entered by mistake.
- Whole-roster clear keeps the class itself but permanently removes every student in it and their linked history.
- Whole-roster clear requires typing `DELETE <class name>` before the button enables.
- Single-student permanent delete was also reduced to one database request.
- Code-only update: no database migration or new Streamlit secret.

### v2.2.2 — Visible Roster Management Hotfix

- Adds an obvious **Roster Management** section directly under each class roster in **Classes & Students**.
- Select one or many students at once.
- **Move selected student(s)** preserves PIN, mastery, Stars, streak, Daily history, Focus work, and Mystery history.
- **Delete selected student(s)** supports permanent bulk cleanup with an explicit confirmation checkbox.
- Existing individual Student Tools remain available.
- Code-only update: no database migration or new Streamlit secret.

### v2.2.0 — Weekly Mystery

Adds the post-routine **Weekly Mystery** motivation loop. Monday-Thursday full completion unlocks clues, each student has one guess for the entire week, and Friday provides the final guess/reveal. Includes an 80-mystery local bank, private solve stats, and a Teacher Dashboard preview/replacement control that locks after the first clue is earned.

The multiplication learning model, Daily generator, accuracy-first Top 10, Focus personalization, mastery evidence, Stars, streaks, and visible teacher PIN system are unchanged.

### v2.1.0 — Research Alignment + Teacher PIN Visibility

Tightened early adaptive exploration around 2s/5s/10s anchor relationships and retained teacher-readable classroom PINs in teacher-only views.

### v2.0.0 — Adaptive Learning Routine

Added **Daily 10 → Fix Your Misses → Your Focus Practice → Done**, persistent individualized mastery with no placement test, eight-fact adaptive Focus sessions, required correction retries, hidden competition timing, Daily Stars and school-day Learning Streaks, private growth views, teacher heatmaps, and Focus overrides.

### v1.0.0 — Full classroom beta

Initial shared Daily 10, class Top 10, student nickname/PIN accounts, visual Practice, teacher roster/dashboard tools, and Supabase persistence.
